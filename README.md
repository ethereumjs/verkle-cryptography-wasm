## Verkle Cryptography (WASM/TypeScript)

Note: This library is in the process of moving over from https://github.com/crate-crypto/rust-verkle-wasm and documentation/instructions are not yet updated.

Javascript implementation of Ethereums verkle trie. This implementation converts Rust verkle's functions into wasm and then wraps these methods in a typescript library to provide a more conventional typescript API.

## Installation

```
    npm i verkle-trie
```
